                           <p>
                            Kaaba in the Quran has been named as the first house that was built for people, as something to remind them of God and toward which they must prostrate and bow down in prayer. Of course, this does not mean the Kaaba (کَعبَة) itself must be worshipped, it is merely a sacred and blessed house that belongs to God and the direction of worship.</p>

                <span>إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِي بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكًا وَهُدًى لِّلْعَالَمِينَ</span>
                <p>Indeed the first house to be set up for mankind is the one at Bakkah, blessed and a guidance for all nations.</p>
                <p>First of all, the word Bakkah is just another name for the city of Mecca. Second, the verse clearly indicates that it was the very first house to be built for mankind. Therefore, Adam, the very first human being was the one who first built the Kaaba. However, during the great flood at the time of Prophet Noah, it was damaged. Therefore, it must have been repaired and rebuilt.</p>
               <p>It is a well-known fact that Ali ibn Abi Talib (علی ابن ابی طالب) was born inside the Kaaba as written in many sources. 5 The story goes that Fatimah Bint Assad was doing tawaf around the Kaaba when she felt the pains of labor and was about to give birth.</p>
